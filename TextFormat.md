# Text Format

The purpose of this text format is to support:
* View Source on a WebAssembly module, thus fitting into the Web (where every
  source can be viewed) in a natural way.
* Presentation in browser development tools when source maps aren't present
  (which is necessarily the case with [the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](MVP.md)).
* Working with WebAssembly code directly for reasons including pedagogical,
  experimental, debugging, profiling, optimization, and testing of the spec
  itself.

The text format is equivalent and isomorphic to the [binary format](BinaryEncoding.md).

The text format will be standardized, but only for tooling purposes; browsers
will not parse the textual format on regular web content in order to implement
WebAssembly semantics.

The text format does not use JavaScript syntax; it is not intended to
be evaluated or translated directly into JavaScript. There are also
substantive reasons to use notation that is different than JavaScript (for
example, WebAssembly has a 32-bit integer type, and it is represented
in the text format, since that is the natural thing to do for WebAssembly,
regardless of JavaScript not having such a type). On the other hand,
when there are no substantive reasons and the options are basically
bikeshedding, then it does make sense for the text format to match existing
conventions on the Web (for example, curly braces, as in JavaScript and CSS).

The text format isn't uniquely representable. Multiple textual files can assemble
to the same binary file, for example whitespace isn't relevant and memory initialization
can be broken out into smaller pieces in the text format.

The text format is precise in that values that cannot be accurately represented in the
binary format are considered invalid text. Floating-point numbers are therefore
represented as hexadecimal floating-point as specified by the C99 standard, which
IEEE-754-2008 section 5.12.3 also specifies. The textual format may be improved to also
support more human-readable representations, but never at the cost of accurate representation.

# ~~Official~~*Experimental* Text Format

## This is an experiment!

This document is a sketch of a possible Text Format proposal for WebAssembly to
use for the "View Source" functionality in browsers. WebAssembly looks enough
like a programming language that it tends to activate our programmer intuitions
about syntax, but it differs from normal programming languages in numerous
respects, so we don't fully trust our intuitions.

So, we're sketching something up, and building a trial implementation of it in
Firefox. This way, we can try it out on real code in a real browser setting, and
see if it actually "works" in practice. Maybe we'll like it and propose it to
the official WebAssembly project. Maybe it'll need changes. Or maybe it'll
totally flop and we'll drop it and pursue something completely different!

Comments, questions, suggestions, and reactions are welcome on
[this repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/sunfishcode/design/issues) for
the moment. As the experiment progresses, we may shift to other discussion
forums, but for now we're keeping it simple.


## Philosophy:

 - Use JS-style sensibilities when there aren't reasons otherwise.
 - It's a compiler target, not a programming language, but readability still counts.


## High-level summary:

 - Curly braces for function bodies, blocks, etc., `/* */`-style and `//`-style
   comments, and whitespace is not significant. Also, no semicolons.
   (TODO: Should `/* */`-style comments nest properly?)

 - `get_local` looks like a simple reference; `set_local` looks like an
   assignment. Constants use a simple literal syntax. This makes wasm's most
   frequent opcodes very concise.

 - Infix syntax for arithmetic, with simple overloading. Explicit grouping via
   parentheses. Concise and familiar with JS and others. (TODO: Use C/JS-style
   operator precedence, or fix
   [an old mistake](http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/dmr-on-or.html)?)

 - Prefix syntax with comma-separated operands for all other operators. For less
   frequent opcodes, prefer just presenting operator names, so that they're easy
   to identify.

 - Typescript-style `name : type` declarations.

 - Parentheses around call arguments, eg. `call $functionname(arg, arg, arg)`,
   and `if` conditions, eg. `if ($condition) { call $then() } else { call $else() }`,
   because they're familiar to many people and not too intrusive.

 - Allow highly complex trees to be syntactically split up into readable parts.

 - Put labels "where they go".


## Examples:

### Basics

```
  function $fac-opt ($a:i64) : (i64) {
    var $x:i64
    $x = 1
    br_if $end ? $a <s 2
    loop $loop {
      $x = $x * $a
      $a = $a + -1
      br_if $loop ? $a >s 1
    }
  $end:
    $x
  }
```

(hand-translated from [fac.wast](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/ml-proto/test/fac.wast))

The function return type has parentheses for symmetry with the parameter types,
anticipating adding multiple return values to wasm in the future.

The curly braces around the function body are not a `block` node; they are part
of the function syntax, reflecting how function bodies in wasm are block-like.

The last expression of the function body here acts as its return value. This
works in all block-like constructs (`block`, function body, `if`, etc.)

`>s` means *signed* greater-than. explicit unsigned or signed operators will be
suffixed with 'u' or 's', respectively.

The `$` sigil on user names cleanly ensures that they never collide with wasm
keywords, present or future.

`br_if` uses a question mark to announce the condition operand. `select` does
also. (TODO: Is this too cute?)

### Linear memory addresses

```
  function $test_redundant_load () : (i32) {
    i32.load [8,+0]
    f32.store [5,+0], -0x0p0
    i32.load [8,+0]
  }
```

(hand-translated from [memory_redundancy.wast](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/ml-proto/test/memory_redundancy.wast))

Addresses are printed as `[base,+offset]`. It could be shortened to `[base]` when
there is no offset; I made the offset explicit above just to illustrate the syntax.
There can also be an optional `:align=â€¦` for non-natural alignments.

### A slightly larger example:

Here's some C code:

```
  float Q_rsqrt(float number)
  {
      long i;
      float x2, y;
      const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

      x2 = number * 0.5F;
      y  = number;
      i  = *(long *) &y;
      i  = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);
      y  = *(float *) &i;
      y  = y * (threehalfs - (x2 * y * y));
      y  = y * (threehalfs - (x2 * y * y));

      return y;
  }
```

Here's the corresponding LLVM wasm backend output + binaryen + slight tweaks:

```
  (func $Q_rsqrt (param $0 f32) (result f32)
    (local $1 f32)
    (set_local $1
      (f32.reinterpret/i32
        (i32.sub
          (i32.const 1597463007)
          (i32.shr_s
            (i32.reinterpret/f32
              (get_local $0))
            (i32.const 1)))))
    (set_local $1
      (f32.mul
        (get_local $1)
        (f32.sub
          (f32.const 1.5)
          (f32.mul
            (get_local $1)
            (f32.mul
              (get_local $1)
              (set_local $0
                (f32.mul
                  (get_local $0)
                  (f32.const 0.5))))))))
    (f32.mul
      (get_local $1)
      (f32.sub
        (f32.const 1.5)
        (f32.mul
          (get_local $1)
          (f32.mul
            (get_local $0)
            (get_local $1)))))
   )
```

And here's the proposed text syntax:

```
   function $Q_rsqrt ($0:f32) : (f32) {
     var $1:f32
     $1 = f32.reinterpret/i32 (1597463007 - ((i32.reinterpret/f32 $0) >> 1))
     $1 = $1 * (0x1.8p0 - $1 * ($0 = $0 * 0x1p-1) * $1)
     $1 * (0x1.8p0 - $1 * $0 * $1)
   }
```

This shows off the compactness of infix operators with overloading. In the
s-expression syntax, these expressions are quite awkward to read, and this
isn't even a very big example. But the text syntax here is very short.

### Labels

Excerpt from labels.wast:

```
  (func $loop3 (result i32)
    (local $i i32)
    (set_local $i (i32.const 0))
    (loop $exit $cont
      (set_local $i (i32.add (get_local $i) (i32.const 1)))
      (if (i32.eq (get_local $i) (i32.const 5))
        (br $exit (get_local $i))
      )
      (get_local $i)
    )
  )
```

Corresponding proposed text syntax:

```
  function $loop3 () : (i32) {
    var $i:i32
    $i = 0
    loop $cont {
      $i = $i + 1
      if ($i == 5) {
        br $exit, $i
      }
    $exit:
    }
  }
```

Note that the curly braces are part of the `if`, rather than introducing a
block. This reflects how `if` essentially provides `block`-like capabilities
in the wasm binary format.

### Nested blocks

Label definitions, like the `$exit:` above, introduce additional blocks nested
within the nearest `{`, without requiring their own `{`. This allows the deep
nesting of `br_table` to be printed in a relatively flat manner:

```
  {
    br_table [$red, $orange, $yellow, $green], $default, $index
  $red:
      // ...
  $orange:
      // ...
  $yellow:
      // ...
  $green:
      // ...
  $default:
  }
```

representing the following in nested form:

```
  (block $default
    (block $green
      (block $yellow
        (block $orange
          (block $red
            (br_table [$red, $orange, $yellow, $green] $default (get_local $index))
          )
          // ...
        )
        // ...
      )
      // ...
    )
    // ...
  )
```

`br_table`s can have large numbers of labels, so this feature allows us to
avoid very deep nesting in many cases.

Note that when a label appears just before the closing `}`, it doesn't introduce
a new block; it just provides a name for the enclosing block's label.

## Operators with special syntax

As mentioned earlier, basic arithmetic operators use an infix notation, some
operators require explicit parentheses, and some operators use `?` to introduce
boolean conditions. The following is a table of special syntax:


## Control flow operators ([described here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/AstSemantics.md))

| Name | Syntax | Examples
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `block` | *label*: | `{ br $a a: }`
| `loop` | `loop` *label* `{` â€¦ `}` | `loop $a { br $a }`
| `if` | `if` (*expr*) `{` *expr** `}` | `if (0) { 1 }`
| `if_else` | `if` (*expr*) `{` *expr** `} else {` *expr**`}` | `if (0) { 1 } else { 2 }`
| `select` | `select` *expr*, *expr* ? *expr* | `select 1, 2 ? $x < $y`
| `br` | `br` *label* | `br $a`
| `br_if` | `br` *label* `?` *expr* | `br $a`, `br $a ? $x < $y`
| `br_table` | `br_table [` *case-label* `,` â€¦ `] ,` *default-label* `,` *expr* | `br_table [$x, $y], $z, 0`

(TODO: as above, are the `?`s too cute?)

## Basic operators ([described here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/AstSemantics.md#constants))

| Name | Syntax | Example
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `i32.const` | â€¦ | `234`, `0xfff7`
| `i64.const` | â€¦ | `234`, `0xfff7`

| `call_indirect` | `call_indirect` *signature-name* `[` *expr* `] (`*expr* `,` â€¦ `)` | `call_indirect $foo [1] (0, 2)`

## Memory-related operators ([described here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/AstSemantics.md#linear-memory-accesses))

| Name | Syntax | Example
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *memory-immediate* | `[` *base-expression* `,` *offset* `]` | `[$base, 4]`
| `i32.load8_s` | `i32.load8_s [` *base-expression* `, +` *offset-immediate* `]` | `i32.load8_s [$base, +4]`
| `i32.load8_s` | `i32.load8_s [` *base-expression* `, +` *offset-immediate* `]:align=` *align* | `i32.load8_s [$base, +4]:align=2`
| `i32.store8` | `i32.store8 [` *base-expression* `, +` *offset-immediate* `]`, *expr* | `i32.store8 [$base, +4], $value`
| `i32.store8` | `i32.store8 [` *base-expression* `, +` *offset-immediate* `]:align=` *align* `,` *expr* | `i32.store8 [$base, +4]:align=2, $value`

The other forms of `load` and `store` are similar.

## Answers to anticipated questions

Q: JS avoids sigils, and uses context-sensitive keywords to avoid trouble.
   Can wasm do this?

A: Sigils are more of a burden when writing code than reading code, and wasm
   will mostly be written by compilers. And it's my subjective opinion that
   it's better to give ourselves maximum flexibility to add new keywords in
   the future without having to be tricky.


Q: Why not let `br` be spelled `break` or `continue` when targeting block and
   loop, respectively?

A: The `br_table` construct has multiple labels, and there may be a mix of
   forward and backward branches, so it isn't always possible to categorize
   branches as forward or backward. Also, `br`, `br_if`, and `br_table` are
   what we have in the spec, so using their actual names avoids needing
   to special-case them.


Q: Why not permit optional semicolons?

A: We don't want people arguing over which way is better. If we don't forbid
   semicolons, the next best option would be to require semicolons. I've
   subjectively chosen to forbid semicolons for now.


# Debug symbol integration

The binary format inherently strips names from functions, locals, globals, etc,
reducing each of these to dense indices. Without help, the text format must
therefore synthesize new names. However, as part of the [tooling](Tooling.md)
story, a lightweight, optional "debug symbol" global section may be defined
which associates names with each indexed entity and, when present, these names
will be used in the text format projected from a binary WebAssembly module.
